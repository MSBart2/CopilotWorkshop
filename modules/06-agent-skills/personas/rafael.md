# Rafael's Path: Agent Skills

## 🎯 Your Focus: What Character Detail v2 Was Missing

Rafael, Character Detail v2 shipped—and it works! But looking at the code, you realize something: the agent built a *functional* feature, not a *polished* one. No error boundaries. Basic spinners instead of skeleton screens. No analytics tracking.

This module helps you create skills that encode **product standards as domain knowledge**. Your Feature Requirements skill will ensure the next feature—Episode Detail—gets what Character Detail v2 missed.

**Your exercises**: 6.3 (Feature Requirements), 6.4 (Effort Estimator)  
**Time**: ~50 minutes  
**Theme**: From forgotten product standards to automatic engineering excellence

## 🧵 The Golden Thread: Your Role

In **Module 05**, custom instructions activated by file pattern (`.test.js` → testing rules). But your product standards aren't about file types—they're about *what you're building*.

When someone asks Copilot to "create a feature for browsing episodes," the feature-requirements skill automatically applies:
- Error boundaries ✅
- Skeleton screens ✅
- Analytics tracking ✅
- Accessibility standards ✅

If you'd had this skill before Module 04, Character Detail v2 would have shipped with all these built in.

## Exercise 6.3: Build the Feature Requirements Skill

> 🧵 **The Golden Thread**: Look at what Character Detail v2 was missing. This skill ensures the next feature gets it right.

### 📖 The Story

**Rafael** reviews the Character Detail v2 code from Module 04. The feature works, users love it—but something's bothering him.

*"The agent built a working feature,"* Rafael says, *"but it didn't include our product standards. No error boundaries. Basic spinners instead of skeleton screens. No analytics tracking. No toast notifications on favorites."*

*"If we had this skill before Module 04,"* Rafael reflects, *"Character Detail v2 would have shipped with all our product standards built in."*

### ❌ The "Before" — What Character Detail v2 Was Missing

Look at what the agent generated in Module 04:

```jsx
// Character Detail v2 - generated by agent in Module 04
function CharacterDetail({ characterId }) {
  const [character, setCharacter] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);  // Just a boolean
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;  // ❌ Basic spinner, not skeleton
  // ❌ No error boundary wrapping this component
  // ❌ No analytics tracking on page view
  // ❌ No toast on favorite/unfavorite
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{character.name}</h1>
      {/* Feature works, but misses product standards */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 🎯 Objective

Create a Feature Requirements skill that generates comprehensive technical specifications with edge cases, acceptance criteria, and API contracts.

### 📋 Steps

1. **Create the skill directory**
   
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/skills/feature-requirements
   ```

2. **Use plan mode to design the skill**
   
   ```
   @agent Help me create a Feature Requirements skill that generates complete 
   technical specifications from high-level feature descriptions.
   
   The skill should include:
   
   1. Specification structure:
      - User story format (As a... I want... So that...)
      - Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
      - Edge cases and error handling
      - API contracts (endpoints, request/response)
      - Database schema implications
   
   2. FanHub domain knowledge:
      - Existing tables: shows, characters, episodes, quotes, users
      - Core entities and relationships
      - Authentication requirements (JWT, session handling)
   
   3. Quality checklist:
      - Security considerations
      - Performance implications
      - Mobile/accessibility requirements
      - Testing requirements
   
   4. Output format:
      - Markdown specification document
      - Ready for engineering review
      - Includes effort estimation section
   ```

3. **Create the SKILL.md file**
   
   Save to `.github/skills/feature-requirements/SKILL.md`

4. **Test with the watchlist feature**
   
   ```
   @workspace Generate a technical specification for: "Let users create custom 
   watchlists of shows they want to follow."
   
   Include database schema, API endpoints, edge cases, and acceptance criteria.
   ```
   
   **Expected output**:
   - Complete user stories
   - Database schema changes
   - API endpoint definitions
   - Edge cases the team would have caught in review
   - Acceptance criteria ready for testing

5. **Test with a more complex feature**
   
   ```
   @workspace Generate a specification for: "Add a recommendation engine that 
   suggests shows based on the user's viewing history and favorite characters."
   ```

### ✅ Success Criteria

## Exercise 6.4: Create the Effort Estimator Skill

> 🧵 **The Golden Thread**: Character Detail v2 shipped. Stakeholders want Episode Detail next. But how long will that take? Rafael doesn't want to guess again.

### 📖 The Story

**Rafael** just left a stakeholder meeting. The success of Character Detail v2 has everyone excited:

- *"Episode Detail pages would be amazing!"*
- *"Can we add show recommendations?"*  
- *"What about user reviews?"*

Rafael's boss asks: *"Character Detail v2 took a sprint. Episode Detail should be similar, right? Can we commit to next sprint?"*

**Marcus** winces: *"Episode Detail is actually more complex. Episodes have transcripts, multiple characters per episode, air dates, streaming links... Character Detail had one character with related data. Episodes have many-to-many relationships."*

*"I almost promised stakeholders we'd ship Episode Detail in one sprint, just like Character Detail..."* Rafael shudders.

### ❌ The "Before" — What Frustration Looks Like

Stakeholder asks: *"Episode Detail should be like Character Detail, right? One sprint?"*

Rafael guesses: "Probably similar?"

Reality: Episode Detail has many-to-many relationships (multiple characters per episode), streaming API integrations, and transcript handling. Actual effort: 2 sprints, not 1.

This happens repeatedly:
- Product underestimates technical complexity
- Engineering feels rushed
- Stakeholders lose trust in estimates

### 🎯 Objective

Create an Effort Estimator skill that analyzes features against your codebase—so you can compare Episode Detail to Character Detail v2 and give stakeholders realistic estimates.

### 📋 Steps

1. **Create the skill directory**
   
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/skills/effort-estimator
   ```

2. **Design the skill with plan mode**
   
   ```
   @agent Help me create an Effort Estimator skill that analyzes features 
   against our codebase and provides realistic effort estimates.
   
   The skill should:
   
   1. Analyze feature complexity:
      - New files/components needed
      - Existing files that need modification
      - Database schema changes required
      - Integration points with existing systems
   
   2. Provide effort breakdown:
      - Frontend work (components, styling, state management)
      - Backend work (routes, database, business logic)
      - Testing work (unit, integration, E2E)
      - Documentation updates
   
   3. Risk assessment:
      - Dependencies on other features
      - Technical debt that might block progress
      - Learning curve for unfamiliar patterns
   
   4. Output format:
      - Story point estimate with confidence level
      - T-shirt size (S/M/L/XL) alternative
      - Detailed breakdown by area
      - Risks and assumptions
   
   5. Use FanHub codebase context:
      - Current file structure in fanhub/
      - Existing patterns and conventions
      - Known technical debt areas
   ```

3. **Create the SKILL.md file**
   
   Save to `.github/skills/effort-estimator/SKILL.md`

4. **Test with Episode Detail — the next feature after Character Detail v2**
   
   ```
   @workspace Estimate the effort for Episode Detail pages.
   
   The feature should:
   - Show episode information (title, air date, synopsis, runtime)
   - Display all characters appearing in that episode (many-to-many)
   - Show memorable quotes from the episode
   - Link to streaming services where available
   - Include previous/next episode navigation
   
   Compare to Character Detail v2 complexity and estimate effort.
   ```
   
   **Expected output**:
   - Size estimate with reasoning ("Larger than Character Detail because...")
   - Breakdown: frontend, backend, testing, documentation
   - Comparison to Character Detail v2
   - Risks and dependencies

5. **Compare with a simpler feature**
   
   ```
   @workspace Estimate the effort to implement: "Add a 'Copy Quote' button 
   to the QuoteDisplay component."
   ```
   
   This should produce a much smaller estimate with a simpler breakdown.

### ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Created `.github/skills/effort-estimator/` directory
- [ ] Skill analyzes actual codebase structure
- [ ] Provides story point AND t-shirt size estimates
- [ ] Breaks down effort by frontend/backend/testing
- [ ] Identifies risks and dependencies
- [ ] Distinguishes between simple and complex features

### ✨ The "After" — The Improved Experience

**Before the skill**: 
- Stakeholder: "Episode Detail should be like Character Detail, right?"
- Rafael: "I think so... one sprint?"

**After the skill**: 
- Stakeholder: "Episode Detail should be like Character Detail, right?"
- Rafael: *Uses effort estimator skill*
- Rafael: "Episode Detail is larger—2 sprints. Character Detail had one-to-many relationships; Episode Detail has many-to-many (multiple characters per episode). We could ship MVP in one sprint without streaming links."

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Estimate accuracy | ~40% | ~75% |
| Stakeholder trust | Low | High |
| Sprint planning | Reactive | Proactive |
| Risk identification | After kickoff | Before commitment |
