# Copilot Chat: Context Mastery for AI Collaboration

The foundation of effective AI-assisted development—providing the right context at the right time

---

## 🎯 Start Here

This talk covers the **fundamentals of using GitHub Copilot Chat**—context mechanisms, chat architecture, and prompt engineering best practices.

**Next Steps:** Once you understand how to use Copilot Chat effectively, see [Copilot Chat Internals](../copilot-chat-internals/) to learn how to **troubleshoot and debug** when things don't work as expected.

## The Context Problem

### Key Points

- **Generic responses from incomplete context**
  AI without context answers in a vacuum—syntax examples, not codebase-specific solutions

- **Quality proportional to context**
  The difference between "Here's generic SQL" and "Based on your schema in `database/schema.sql`..."

- **Manual context management is cognitive overhead**
  Developers shouldn't have to think about what context to provide for every interaction

- **Context window limitations**
  Large codebases can't be fully loaded—strategic context selection matters

### Narrative

When developers first use GitHub Copilot Chat, they often get generic or irrelevant responses. They ask "How do I add a character to the database?" and receive textbook SQL syntax instead of code that fits their schema, API patterns, and validation rules. This isn't a flaw in the AI—it's a context problem. Copilot responds based on what it knows. Without explicit context about your specific files, architecture, and codebase, it answers generically. The quality of AI responses is directly proportional to the quality of context you provide. Mastering context mechanisms transforms Copilot from "fancy autocomplete" into a genuine force multiplier.

## Chat Architecture: Understanding the Interface

### Two Modalities

**Sidebar Chat (Chat View):**
- Persistent conversation history
- Multi-turn conversations with context accumulation
- Access to all context mechanisms (#-mentions, @-mentions, images)
- Best for exploratory work, planning, and complex discussions

**Inline Chat (Editor-Integrated):**
- Quick, contextual edits directly in the editor
- Automatically includes current file and selection
- Lightweight UX for refactoring, documentation, and quick fixes
- New in VS Code 1.109: Revamped contextual rendering (`inlineChat.renderMode`)

### Auto Model Selection

GitHub Copilot automatically selects the best available model based on:
- Your subscription tier (Free, Pro, Pro+, Enterprise)
- Model availability and load
- Organizational policies

**Key benefits:**
- No manual model selection required
- Pro+ subscribers get 10% discount on premium requests when using Auto
- Enterprises can enforce model policies across teams

### Context Window Visibility

New in VS Code 1.109: The chat input area now shows a **context window indicator**. Hover to see token usage breakdown by category—helping you understand how your context budget is being consumed.

## Core Context Mechanisms

### Implicit Context (Automatic)

VS Code automatically includes:
- ✅ Currently selected text in the active editor
- ✅ The active file name and path
- ✅ Active file contents (in inline chat)
- ✅ Visible errors and diagnostics

**When to rely on implicit context:**
- Working on the current file with selection
- Quick inline edits and refactoring
- Obvious context from the active editor

### Explicit Context: `#file`

Reference specific files when you know exactly what Copilot needs:

```
Without context:
"What database tables exist in this project?"

With file context:
"What database tables exist? #file:backend/database/schema.sql"
```

**Multiple files:**
```
"How do the character routes connect to the database?
#file:backend/routes/characters.js
#file:backend/database/connection.js"
```

**When to use `#file`:**
- You know exactly which file contains the relevant information
- Cross-referencing between specific files
- Reviewing or understanding specific implementation details

### Explicit Context: `@workspace`

Project-wide understanding when you need the big picture:

```
@workspace What is the overall architecture of this application?
What technologies are used?
```

**What `@workspace` does:**
- Searches your entire codebase
- Finds relevant files automatically
- Provides project-specific responses, not generic

**When to use `@workspace`:**
- New to a codebase—understanding structure
- Broad architectural questions
- Finding patterns across the project

### Explicit Context: `#codebase`

Semantic search when you don't know which file contains what you need:

```
#codebase Where is authentication configured?
```

```
#codebase Show me all the API routes related to characters
```

**What `#codebase` does:**
- Searches semantically (by meaning, not just keywords)
- Finds files even without knowing exact names
- More targeted than `@workspace` for specific questions

**New in VS Code 1.109:** External indexing for non-GitHub workspaces enables the same fast semantic search for local projects.

### Explicit Context: `#fetch`

Reference external documentation for current, authoritative information:

```
How should I structure React components?
#fetch https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react
```

```
What are the latest Express.js best practices for error handling?
#fetch https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html
```

**When to use `#fetch`:**
- Need current framework documentation
- Referencing APIs that have changed recently
- Ensuring responses align with official guidance

### Visual Context: Images

Drag-and-drop images onto the Chat view for visual understanding:

```
[Drag image of a UI mockup]
"Create a React component that matches this design"
```

```
[Screenshot of error message]
"What's causing this error and how do I fix it?"
```

**When to use images:**
- Implementing UI from mockups or designs
- Debugging visual issues or error dialogs
- Explaining complex diagrams or architectures

## Context Decision Guide

| When you... | Use... | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Know the exact file | `#file:path/to/file` | `#file:src/components/Header.jsx` |
| Need project overview | `@workspace` | `@workspace What's the folder structure?` |
| Looking for something specific | `#codebase` | `#codebase Where is error handling?` |
| Need current external docs | `#fetch <URL>` | `#fetch https://react.dev` |
| Have a UI mockup/error screenshot | Drag image to chat | [image] "Implement this design" |
| Working on the current file | Nothing! (implicit) | File is auto-included |

## VS Code 1.109 Chat UX Enhancements

The January 2026 release brought significant improvements to the Chat experience:

### Anthropic Models with Thinking Tokens

Claude models now surface thinking tokens for visibility into reasoning:

- **Configurable thinking styles:** `chat.thinking.style` (detailed or compact)
- **Interleaved thinking:** See model reasoning between tool calls (`chat.agent.thinking.terminalTools`)
- **Auto-expand failures:** Failing tool calls show more context automatically (`chat.tools.autoExpandFailures`)
- **Visual enhancements:** Scrollable thinking content, shimmer animations

### Mermaid Diagrams in Chat

Chat responses can render interactive diagrams with the `renderMermaidDiagram` tool:

- **Pan and zoom:** Alt/Option + mouse wheel
- **Click to zoom:** Alt/Option + click (add Shift to zoom out)
- **Open in editor:** Full-sized view for larger diagrams
- **Copy source:** Right-click to copy Mermaid source code

Diagrams help models visually break down complex concepts—flowcharts, sequence diagrams, architecture visualizations.

### Ask Questions Tool (Experimental)

When something is unclear, the agent can ask clarifying questions:

- **Interactive UI:** Single/multi-select options, free text input
- **Keyboard navigation:** Up/Down arrows, number keys for quick selection
- **Catches ambiguity early:** Prevents misunderstandings before code generation
- **Enable:** `chat.askQuestions.enabled`

### Plan Agent Enhancements

The built-in Plan agent now follows a structured 4-phase workflow:

1. **Discovery** — Autonomously explores codebase, finds relevant files
2. **Alignment** — Pauses to ask clarifying questions before committing
3. **Design** — Drafts comprehensive implementation plan with steps and code snippets
4. **Refinement** — Adds verification criteria and documents decisions

**Quick access:** `/plan` command in chat

### Inline Chat UX Revamp (Preview)

Two new experimental features for lighter, more contextual editing:

- **Easier triggering:** `inlineChat.affordance` makes it easier to trigger when selecting text
- **Lightweight rendering:** `inlineChat.renderMode` for cleaner contextual display

### Terminal Command Improvements

Terminal tool output now shows richer details:

- **Syntax highlighting** for inline Node, Python, Ruby
- **Working directory** shown in title
- **Command intent description** on hover
- **Output streaming:** Auto-expands for long-running commands
- **Interactive input:** Embedded terminals are fully interactive

## Best Practices

### Context Layering Strategy

**Start broad, then narrow:**
1. Use `@workspace` to understand overall structure
2. Identify relevant areas with `#codebase`
3. Focus with specific `#file` references
4. Add external docs with `#fetch` as needed

### Context Efficiency

**Avoid context overload:**
- Don't include every file—be strategic
- Let Copilot discover with `@workspace` or `#codebase` first
- Use the context window indicator to monitor usage

**Leverage persistent context:**
- Instructions files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) are auto-loaded
- Agent definitions provide domain-specific context
- Skills package reusable expertise

### Conversation Management

**Multi-turn conversations:**
- Context accumulates within a session
- Start new sessions for unrelated topics
- Use `/compact` to compress history in long sessions

**Session types (new in 1.109):**
- Local sessions for interactive work
- Background agents for parallel tasks
- Cloud agents for large-scale operations
- Seamlessly switch between types

## Metrics and ROI

### Quantifiable Improvements

| Before Context Mastery | After Context Mastery |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| 5-8 attempts to get useful response | 1-2 attempts with right context |
| Generic code requiring extensive modification | Codebase-specific implementations |
| Constant context-switching to find files | AI discovers relevant files automatically |
| Documentation lookup interrupting flow | `#fetch` brings docs into conversation |

### Team Impact

- **Onboarding acceleration:** New team members understand codebases faster with `@workspace`
- **Knowledge scaling:** Context mechanisms surface institutional knowledge
- **Reduced review cycles:** Context-aware suggestions match team patterns

## Key Takeaways

### Core Insights

1. **Context is the differentiator** — Same AI, dramatically different results based on context quality
2. **Master the mechanisms** — `#file`, `@workspace`, `#codebase`, `#fetch`, images each have optimal use cases
3. **Leverage automatic features** — Auto model selection, context window visibility, thinking tokens
4. **Layer context strategically** — Broad to narrow, implicit to explicit
5. **Use VS Code 1.109 features** — Plan agent, Ask Questions tool, Mermaid diagrams enhance collaboration

### Narrative

Context mastery is the foundation of effective AI-assisted development. It's not about the model—it's about what you give the model to work with. Developers who master context mechanisms get codebase-specific solutions on the first try. Those who don't spend cycles fighting generic responses. The 1.109 release makes this easier than ever with visible context windows, clarifying questions, and structured planning workflows. Invest time in understanding these mechanisms once, and every AI interaction becomes more productive.

## Getting Started

### Immediate Actions

1. **Try the context mechanisms** — Open Copilot Chat and experiment with `#file`, `@workspace`, `#codebase`
2. **Enable experimental features** — Turn on `chat.askQuestions.enabled` and `inlineChat.affordance`
3. **Monitor context usage** — Watch the context window indicator as you work

### Next Steps

1. **Set up instructions** — Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for persistent project context
2. **Explore agents** — Custom agents build on context mastery with domain-specific expertise
3. **Layer customizations** — Instructions → prompts → agents → skills compound your context investment

### Narrative

Start with the fundamentals: explicit context mechanisms. Once you're comfortable providing context manually, move to persistent context through instructions and agents. Each layer builds on the previous, compounding your effectiveness. The goal is less manual context management over time as your customizations encode institutional knowledge.
