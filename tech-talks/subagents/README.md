# ⚠️ This Talk Has Moved

**This content has been reorganized by use-case.**

## Where to Find This Content Now

This talk about **subagents** has been reorganized into:

👉 **[Multi-Step Tasks](../multi-step-tasks/)**

**New focus:** When your task needs research → analysis → implementation phases with context isolation

---

## Why the Change?

We reorganized agent-related talks from **mechanism-focused** to **use-case-focused** to make it easier to find the right pattern for your needs.

### Old Organization (Mechanism-Focused)
- ❌ subagents
- ❌ agent-orchestration
- ❌ agentic-sessions

### New Organization (Use-Case-Focused)
- ✅ Multi-Step Tasks — Task decomposition with phases
- ✅ Agent Teams — Specialized roles working together
- ✅ Parallel Execution — Simultaneous work on different branches

---

## Quick Decision Guide

**Not sure which talk you need?**

```
Q: What's your use case?
├─ Task needs multiple phases (research → analysis → implementation)
│  └─ Go to: multi-step-tasks/
│
├─ Task needs specialized roles (planner vs. coder vs. reviewer)
│  └─ Go to: agent-teams/
│
└─ Task can run in parallel on different branches
   └─ Go to: parallel-execution/
```
