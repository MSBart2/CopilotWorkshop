# ⚠️ This Talk Has Moved

**This content has been reorganized by use-case.**

## Where to Find This Content Now

This talk about **agent orchestration** has been reorganized into:

👉 **[Agent Teams](../agent-teams/)**

**New focus:** When you need specialized roles (planner, coder, reviewer) working together in a conductor/worker pattern

---

## Why the Change?

We reorganized agent-related talks from **mechanism-focused** to **use-case-focused** to make it easier to find the right pattern for your needs.

### Old Organization (Mechanism-Focused)
- ❌ subagents
- ❌ agent-orchestration
- ❌ agentic-sessions

### New Organization (Use-Case-Focused)
- ✅ Multi-Step Tasks — Task decomposition with phases
- ✅ Agent Teams — Specialized roles working together
- ✅ Parallel Execution — Simultaneous work on different branches
