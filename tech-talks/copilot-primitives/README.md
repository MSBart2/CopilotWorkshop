## The Problem

### Key Points

- **Generic responses that ignore project conventions**
  Copilot suggests textbook patterns instead of code that matches your team's architecture, naming conventions, and technology stack

- **Repeated context in every conversation**
  Developers manually explain the same project details — "we use Prisma, not raw SQL" — in every chat session

- **Inconsistent AI behavior across a team**
  Each developer gets different quality responses because they provide different context. No shared baseline.

- **One-size-fits-all doesn't fit anyone**
  Default Copilot treats a React frontend and a Python data pipeline identically. It shouldn't.

### Narrative

When developers first adopt GitHub Copilot, the initial experience is impressive — but quickly hits a ceiling. You ask Copilot to add a database table and it generates raw SQL when your project uses Prisma. You ask for a test and it suggests Mocha patterns when your team standardized on Vitest. Every conversation starts from zero because Copilot has no memory of your project's conventions.

This isn't a limitation of the AI model — it's a context problem. Copilot's response quality is directly proportional to how much it knows about your specific codebase[^1]. Without explicit configuration, it answers generically, like a contractor who's never seen your blueprints.

The solution isn't better prompting. It's **configuration** — four primitives that, once set up, give every Copilot interaction persistent awareness of your codebase's architecture, conventions, and workflows[^3].

---

## The Solution: 4 Configuration Primitives

### What It Does

GitHub Copilot supports four configuration building blocks that progressively add context and capabilities to every AI interaction. Each primitive is a Markdown file committed to your repository, making your Copilot configuration version-controlled, team-shared, and reviewable[^1].

### Key Capabilities

- **Instructions**: Always-on guardrails — coding standards, project structure, and build procedures injected into every request automatically[^2]
- **Skills**: On-demand capability packs — specialized knowledge with scripts and resources, loaded only when relevant[^4]
- **Prompts**: Reusable task templates — standardized workflows invoked via `/command` syntax in chat[^3]
- **Agents**: Specialized AI personas — constrained tools, instructions, and model preferences for specific roles[^5]

### Architecture Overview

The four primitives form a progressive stack. Instructions are the foundation — always present, zero-effort. Skills add specialized capabilities loaded on-demand by AI relevance matching. Prompts encode repeatable workflows triggered by the developer. Agents sit at the top, orchestrating the other primitives into constrained personas with specific tool access.

Each primitive builds on the ones below it. An agent can reference instructions and invoke skills. A prompt can specify which agent to run with. Instructions form the shared baseline that everything else inherits[^3].

## 🎯 Mental Model Shift

> **The Core Insight:** From repeating context in every conversation to encoding knowledge once in configuration files that make every interaction smarter.

### Move Toward (Embrace These Patterns)

- ✅ **File-based configuration over manual context**: Encode conventions in `.github/` once instead of repeating them in every prompt → Copilot automatically applies your standards to every interaction[^2]
- ✅ **Progressive enhancement**: Start with one `copilot-instructions.md`, add skills and agents only when clear need emerges → Avoids over-engineering, delivers value immediately
- ✅ **Team-shared AI knowledge in version control**: Configuration files become reviewable institutional knowledge → New team members get project-aware AI from day one
- ✅ **Layered context**: Instructions for baseline, skills for capabilities, agents for orchestration → Each layer serves a different purpose without duplication

### Move Away From (Retire These Habits)

- ⚠️ **Copy-pasting context into every prompt**: Instructions eliminate this repetitive work → Saves minutes per interaction, hundreds of hours per year across a team
- ⚠️ **One-size-fits-all AI interaction**: Different tasks need different context levels → A planning task needs different tools than an implementation task
- ⚠️ **Treating Copilot configuration as optional**: Default Copilot is 10x less effective than configured Copilot → Every team should at minimum have instructions

### Move Against (Active Resistance Required)

- 🛑 **Over-engineering with agents first**: 80% of teams get most value from instructions alone → Premature complexity wastes setup time and can even reduce quality
- 🛑 **Massive instruction files**: Keep instructions under 2 pages — bloated files consume context that should be used for your actual question → Quality degrades when instructions exceed token budget
- 🛑 **Task-specific content in instructions**: Instructions should be general conventions, not step-by-step workflows → Use prompts for task-specific workflows instead

> **Example Transformation:** Before: Developer types "Add a user endpoint" and gets generic Express boilerplate with `var`, no types, and `console.log` error handling. After: Same prompt produces TypeScript endpoint with Prisma queries, custom error classes, JSDoc comments, and co-located test file — because instructions define the conventions and a prompt encodes the scaffolding workflow.

---

## When to Use This Pattern

### Decision Tree

```
Q: What kind of customization do you need?
│
├─ "Copilot should always know our conventions"
│  → Use: Instructions (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
│  └─ Best for: Coding standards, build procedures, architecture docs
│
├─ "Different rules for different parts of the codebase"
│  → Use: Path-specific Instructions (.instructions.md with applyTo)
│  └─ Best for: Language-specific rules, framework conventions per directory
│
├─ "Reusable capabilities across projects and tools"
│  → Use: Skills (.github/skills/*/SKILL.md)
│  └─ Best for: Testing workflows, deployment scripts, portable expertise
│
├─ "Standardized workflows the team can invoke"
│  → Use: Prompts (.github/prompts/*.prompt.md)
│  └─ Best for: Component scaffolding, code review checklists, PR templates
│
└─ "Specialized AI persona with constrained tools"
   → Use: Agents (.github/agents/*.agent.md)
   └─ Best for: Planning vs. implementation, database admin, security review
```

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Instructions -->
## Instructions: The Foundation

Instructions are Markdown files that provide persistent context to every Copilot interaction. They're the simplest and most impactful primitive — a single file can transform Copilot from "generic coding assistant" to "team-aware development partner"[^2].

### How Instructions Work

When you create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository, its contents are automatically injected into every Copilot Chat request made in that repository context[^1]. No special syntax, no activation step — just Markdown that Copilot reads before answering.

VS Code shows which instruction files were used in the **References** section of each chat response, so you can verify they're being applied[^2].

### Repository-Wide Instructions

The primary instructions file lives at `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and applies to all requests:

```markdown
# Repository Instructions

This repository uses TypeScript with strict type checking enabled.

## Build and Test
- Always run `npm install` before building
- Build: `npm run build`
- Tests are in `__tests__/` directories co-located with source files
- Use Jest for testing with the config in `jest.config.js`
- Run tests: `npm test`

## Coding Standards
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use explicit return types for all functions
- Add JSDoc comments for exported functions
- Use named exports (avoid default exports)

## File Structure
src/
  components/       # React components
  utils/           # Utility functions
  services/        # API clients
  __tests__/       # Tests co-located with source

## Error Handling
- Use custom error classes that extend Error
- Log errors with structured logging (use logger.error())
- Never swallow errors silently
```

See the full example in [`examples/copilot-instructions.md`](examples/copilot-instructions.md).

### Path-Specific Instructions

For codebases where different areas have different conventions, use `.instructions.md` files with `applyTo` glob patterns[^2]:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "src/models/**/*.ts"
---

# Database Model Instructions

When working with database models in this project:

1. Use Prisma schema definitions in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Include JSDoc comments with field descriptions
3. Define relationships explicitly with `@relation`
4. Add indexes for foreign keys
5. Use snake_case for database column names, camelCase in TypeScript
6. Always include audit fields: `createdAt` and `updatedAt`
```

Path-specific instructions are stored in `.github/instructions/` and only activate when Copilot is working on files matching the glob pattern. They combine with repository-wide instructions — both are used when both match[^1].

**Key Points:**
- Instructions are always-on — no manual activation required
- Keep under 2 pages for optimal performance (context budget)
- Personal instructions > repository instructions > organization instructions (priority order)
- Use the `/init` command to auto-generate instructions from your workspace[^2]

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Skills -->
## Skills: On-Demand Expertise

Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file plus supporting scripts, examples, and resources. Unlike instructions that are always active, skills are loaded on-demand when Copilot determines they're relevant to your current task[^4].

### How Skills Work: Progressive Loading

Skills use a three-level loading system that keeps context efficient[^4]:

| Level | What Loads | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **1. Discovery** | Skill name + description only | Always (lightweight metadata) |
| **2. Instructions** | Full SKILL.md body | When your prompt matches the skill description |
| **3. Resources** | Scripts, examples, templates | When Copilot references them during execution |

This means you can have dozens of skills installed without impacting context — only relevant skills load their full content.

### Skill Structure

```
.github/skills/
  test-runner/
    SKILL.md              # Instructions + metadata
    test-template.ts      # Template test file
    scripts/
      run-tests.sh        # Test execution script
    examples/
      api-test.ts         # Example test for reference
```

### Example: Test Runner Skill

```markdown
---
name: test-runner
description: Run tests, analyze failures, and suggest fixes for unit and
  integration tests. Use when asked to test, debug test failures, or add
  test coverage.
---

# Test Runner Skill

## When to Use
- User asks to test an API endpoint
- User wants to validate request/response contracts
- Debugging failing integration tests

## Process
1. Identify the endpoint under test from route files in `src/routes/`
2. Check existing tests in `tests/api/` for patterns
3. Use the test template in [template](./test-template.ts)
4. Run tests with `npm run test:api`
```

See the full skill definition in [`examples/test-runner-skill.md`](examples/test-runner-skill.md).

### Skills Are an Open Standard

Agent Skills work across VS Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and GitHub Copilot coding agent[^7]. Skills you write for VS Code automatically work in the terminal and in GitHub's automated coding workflows. The specification is maintained at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/).

**Key Points:**
- Skills are loaded on-demand, not always active (saves context budget)
- Can include executable scripts, test templates, and reference examples
- Portable across VS Code, Copilot CLI, and Copilot coding agent[^7]
- Store project skills in `.github/skills/`, personal skills in `~/.copilot/skills/`

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Custom Prompts -->
## Custom Prompts: Reusable Workflows

Prompt files are Markdown templates that encode repeatable development workflows. Unlike instructions (always-on) or skills (AI-activated), prompts are explicitly invoked by developers using `/command` syntax in chat[^3].

### How Prompts Work

Create a `.prompt.md` file in `.github/prompts/`, and it becomes available as a slash command. Type `/` in chat, select your prompt, and optionally provide parameters[^3]:

```
/component MyButtonGroup
```

### Prompt File Structure

```markdown
---
name: component
description: Generate a React component with TypeScript, tests, and docs
tools: ['editFiles', 'createFile']
agent: agent
---

# Component Generator

Create a new React component following our team's standards.

## Files to Create

Generate the following structure:

src/components/{{componentName}}/
  {{componentName}}.tsx           # Component implementation
  {{componentName}}.types.ts      # TypeScript interfaces
  {{componentName}}.module.css    # CSS Modules styles
  __tests__/
    {{componentName}}.test.tsx    # Unit tests
  index.ts                        # Barrel export

## Requirements
- Use functional components with hooks
- Include TypeScript props interface with JSDoc
- Follow conventions in [coding standards](../../copilot-instructions.md)
- Add unit tests using Vitest
```

See the full prompt in [`examples/component.prompt.md`](examples/component.prompt.md).

### What Makes Prompts Powerful

Prompts can reference instructions files via Markdown links, ensuring consistency without duplication. They support variable interpolation (`${input:variableName}`, `${selection}`, `${file}`) and can specify which agent and tools to use[^3]:

```markdown
---
tools: ['editFiles', 'search', 'readFile']
agent: agent
model: Claude Sonnet 4 (copilot)
---
```

**Key Points:**
- Prompts are user-invoked — they only run when you type `/command`
- Can reference instructions files to reuse conventions without duplication
- Support variables: `${selection}`, `${file}`, `${input:name:placeholder}`
- Specify tools and agent to constrain execution
- Store in `.github/prompts/` (workspace) or user profile (global)

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Agents -->
## Agents: Specialized AI Personas

Custom agents combine instructions, tool restrictions, and model preferences into a specialized persona that you select from the agents dropdown in chat[^5]. Where instructions set the rules and prompts define tasks, agents define **who** the AI becomes for a session.

### Why Constrain the AI?

Different tasks need different capabilities. A planning agent should only read files (preventing accidental edits). A security reviewer needs search tools but not terminal access. A database admin needs terminal and SQL tools but shouldn't touch frontend code[^5].

Agents let you configure exactly which tools are available — and which aren't.

### Agent File Structure

```markdown
---
name: planner
description: Generate implementation plans by researching the codebase.
  Read-only — never modifies files.
tools: ['search', 'readFile', 'listFiles', 'fetch']
model: Claude Sonnet 4 (copilot)
handoffs:
  - label: Start Implementation
    agent: agent
    prompt: Implement the plan outlined above.
    send: false
---

# Planning Agent

You are a senior software architect creating implementation plans.

## Your Process
1. Understand the requirement by asking clarifying questions
2. Research the existing codebase using search and file reading
3. Identify affected files and components
4. Generate a step-by-step implementation plan with:
   - Files to create or modify
   - Key code changes described in detail
   - Test strategy
   - Potential risks or considerations

## Rules
- NEVER modify files — you are read-only
- Always cite specific files and line numbers
- Include effort estimates for each step
```

### Handoffs: Multi-Agent Workflows

Agents support **handoffs** — suggested next steps that transition between agents with context preserved[^5]. After the planning agent finishes, a "Start Implementation" button appears that switches to the implementation agent with the plan as context:

```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: Start Implementation
    agent: agent
    prompt: Implement the plan outlined above.
    send: false
  - label: Review Code
    agent: security-reviewer
    prompt: Review the implementation for security issues.
```

This creates guided, sequential workflows: Plan → Implement → Review. Each agent has its own tools and constraints, but context flows between them.

### Example: Database Administrator Agent

The database agent in [`examples/database.agent.md`](examples/database.agent.md) demonstrates a fully specified agent with:
- Constrained tools (terminal, code_editor, database_query)
- Specific model selection (claude-sonnet-4)
- Temperature setting (0.3 for consistency)
- Detailed persona instructions covering schema design, migrations, and query optimization

**Key Points:**
- Agents constrain which tools the AI can use for a specific role
- Handoffs enable guided multi-agent workflows (Plan → Implement → Review)
- Agents can reference instructions and invoke skills
- Subagents can run as delegated tasks within an agent session[^5]
- Store in `.github/agents/` (workspace) or user profile (global)

---

<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: Choosing the Right Primitive -->
## Choosing the Right Primitive

### Start Simple, Add Complexity When Needed

Most teams should follow this progression:

| Week | Action | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Week 1** | Add `copilot-instructions.md` with project basics | Immediate: project-aware responses |
| **Week 2** | Add path-specific `.instructions.md` files | Targeted: language-specific conventions |
| **Week 3** | Create first prompt for your most common task | Consistent: standardized team workflows |
| **Month 2** | Add skills for capabilities that span projects | Portable: cross-tool expertise |
| **Month 3** | Create agents for complex orchestration needs | Advanced: multi-step autonomous workflows |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | What to Do Instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Start with agents | Over-engineers simple problems | Start with instructions |
| 5-page instructions file | Consumes context budget for actual work | Keep under 2 pages |
| Task-specific instructions | Bloats every request with irrelevant context | Use prompts for tasks |
| Duplicating rules across files | Creates maintenance burden and conflicts | Reference instructions from prompts |
| Skipping configuration entirely | Leaves 80% of Copilot's value unused | Spend 5 minutes on instructions |

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Monorepo with Multiple Technologies

**The Problem:** Large repository with React frontend, Node.js backend, and React Native mobile — Copilot suggests wrong patterns for each area.

**The Solution:** Path-specific instructions apply TypeScript/React conventions for `src/web/**`, Express patterns for `src/api/**`, and React Native best practices for `src/mobile/**`.

```markdown
---
applyTo: "src/web/**/*.tsx"
---
# Frontend Instructions
- Use React functional components with hooks
- Style with TailwindCSS utility classes
- Use React Query for data fetching
```

**Outcome:** 40% reduction in code review style comments. Copilot matches the right framework conventions automatically.

---

### Use Case 2: Test-Driven Development Standardization

**The Problem:** Team practices TDD but each developer generates tests differently — inconsistent patterns, missing edge cases.

**The Solution:** `/test` prompt file generates tests following team standards. Test-runner skill analyzes failures and suggests fixes using project-specific patterns.

**Outcome:** New developers write conformant tests from day one. 25% faster debugging of test failures through skill-guided analysis.

---

### Use Case 3: Database Schema Changes with Safety

**The Problem:** Multiple developers making schema changes create inconsistent migrations, missing indexes, and no rollback safety.

**The Solution:** Database admin agent with constrained tools enforces Third Normal Form, generates up/down migrations, suggests indexes, and provides EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

**Outcome:** Zero production migration rollbacks in 6 months. 60% faster schema review process.

---

### Use Case 4: Accelerated Onboarding

**The Problem:** New team members take 2 weeks to make their first meaningful commit because they don't understand codebase conventions.

**The Solution:** Instructions document architecture and conventions. `/onboard` prompt provides guided codebase tour. Copilot answers "where is X?" questions correctly from day one.

**Outcome:** Onboarding time reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days for first meaningful commit.

## 🎭 Behind the Scenes

### How Primitives Load at Runtime

Understanding the loading order clarifies why the layered architecture matters:

1. **Session Start**: VS Code scans for `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `AGENTS.md` — these are always loaded
2. **File Open**: VS Code checks `.instructions.md` files for matching `applyTo` patterns — loaded if glob matches current file
3. **Chat Request**: Skill discovery runs — names and descriptions are checked against user prompt for relevance
4. **Skill Match**: If a skill description matches, its full `SKILL.md` body is loaded into context (Level 2)
5. **Agent Selection**: When user switches to a custom agent, its instructions and tool constraints replace defaults
6. **Prompt Invocation**: When user types `/command`, prompt file merges with current instructions + agent context

### Context Budget Management

All primitives share the model's context window. This is why the progressive loading architecture matters — always-on instructions consume baseline budget, on-demand skills only load when needed, and unused agents consume nothing.

**Rule of thumb**: Instructions (2 pages max) + active skill + prompt + your conversation history should fit comfortably within context. If you're hitting limits, your instructions are probably too long.

### Tool Priority Resolution

When multiple primitives specify tools, the priority order is[^3]:

1. Tools specified in prompt file (highest priority)
2. Tools from the referenced custom agent in prompt file
3. Default tools for the selected agent (lowest priority)

**Key Takeaway:** If a prompt specifies tools, those override any agent-level tool restrictions. Design your tool lists intentionally to avoid accidental privilege escalation.
