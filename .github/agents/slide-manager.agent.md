# Slide Manager Agent (Condensed)

**📖 Full Documentation:** See `/docs/agents-slide-manager.agent.md`

Orchestrates slide generation and verification workflow.

## Workflow

0. **Check Status** - If the target slide already exists, read its frontmatter. If `status: archived`, **STOP** and report: "This slide deck is archived and cannot be regenerated or modified." Skip to reporting.
1. **Generate** - Call slide-generator agent with content path
2. **Sync Dates** - Run `node slides/scripts/sync-index-dates.mjs` to update the NEW badge data in `index-custom.html`
3. **Verify** - Run slide-verifier in smart mode (lint first, Playwright only if issues)
4. **Report** - Summary of pass/fail with issue details. Include `status` and `updated` date in the report.

## Usage

```
Use slide-manager agent to create slides for workshop/03-custom-prompts
```

## Features

- **Fast** - Smart verification (2-6 min vs 15+ min full Playwright)
- **Actionable** - Reports specific issues with slide numbers
- **No auto-fix** - Issues reported for manual resolution or targeted @slide-fixer
